# Falling Flashcards Game

[**Play Online!**](https://zombiecalypse.github.io/DropCard/)

A simple web-based flashcard game to help you study. Answer the prompts on the falling cards before they reach the bottom of the screen!

## How to Play

-   Cards with questions will start falling from the top of the screen.
-   Type your answer in the input box at the bottom and press `Enter`.
-   If your answer is correct, the card disappears and your score increases.
-   If a card reaches the bottom of the screen, you lose one health point.
-   The game ends when you run out of health.
-   You can pause and resume the game by pressing `Enter` while the input box is empty.

## Development

1.  Clone the repository.

## Why?

This is an experiment for trying out coding agents in a green-field environment. Plus I want to learn welsh.
